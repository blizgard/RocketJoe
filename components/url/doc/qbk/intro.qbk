[section:intro Introduction]

[heading Design]

The design of the mutable container achieves these goals:

The caller can produce all possible valid URLs using the
  modification functions.

The URL always remains syntactically valid after modification:

The order of modification of URL parts generally does
not affect the resulting URL.

The library adds separators when needed, in the cases
  where the user's intent is unambiguous, or

The library throws an exception when an ambiguous
  modification would leave the URL in a syntactically
  invalid state.

Perform modifications using a pre-allocated buffer

Avoid all dynamic allocations
